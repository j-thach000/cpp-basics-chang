/*
Problem 3.7: If the following program doesn't compile, why not? 
If it does compile, what is the output when it is run?

it should compile since it's just a blank for loop statement and the semicolon ends the thought
it should output nothing
the above is correct, just missing the fact that this is an infinite loop
the program just loops nothing infinitely and hangs
